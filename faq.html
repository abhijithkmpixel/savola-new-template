              ● The transaction involves three stages consisting of a rights
              issue of SR 6 billion, which is followed by a capital reduction,
              and the distribution of Savola's entire stake of 34.52% in Almarai
              directly to its shareholders.
              <br />
              <br />
              ● All three stages will require EGM and regulatory approvals.

            <h4>What will be the impact on Savola’s capital structure?</h4>
            <p>
              ● Savola aims to strengthen its financial position, pay down its
              debt, and continue to invest in the growth of its portfolio.
              <br /><br />● The aim is to achieve a more conservative leverage

            <p>
              ● The rationale is to unlock value. Over the past years, Savola’s
              market capitalization is approximately equal to the market value
              of its stake in Almarai.

            </h4>
            <p>
              ● Almarai has been the most successful investment for Savola Group
              to date, with the value of Savola’s investment in the company
              increasing more than 100-fold since the initial investment in
              1991.
              <br /><br />
              ● Historically, the market capitalization of Savola has closely
              tracked the market value of the stake held by Savola in Almarai.
              <br /><br />
              ● Going forward, Savola will focus on investing in the growth of
              its core food and retail businesses and shareholders will continue
              to benefit from direct exposure to this growth too.
              <br /><br />
              ● Savola will also continue to review strategic options to realize
              value from portfolio companies that demonstrate attractive
              distribution and monetization potential.
